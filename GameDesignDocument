Game Design Document for "Generic Spaceship Game" (GDC for GSG).

Objective: Survive and destroy the enemy space-ships.

Mechanics:

-Small ships appear and shoot the player.
-The player can shoot (control or left-click).
-The player character aims in the direction of the mouse and moves with either WASD or the arrow keys.
-The map is seemingly infinite (it's space afterall).
-Player can collide with ships.
-The player has a radar to find the enemies.
-Player has 30 HP.
-Normal enemy shots take 10 HP from the player.
-Radar can be turned off before starting the game, as a handicap for the player.
-(Pending) Secondary attack for the player: a PEM bomb that momentarily disables nearby enemies and does AOE damage (one of these is given to the player each 5 or 10 ships destroyed; this will be adjusted during play-testing).
-If the player gets too close to an enemy ship, the enemy will find the player.
-If the enemy sees a player bullet or gets shoted from behind, the enemy will find the player. (It's space-age, they probably know how to calculate where a laser was shoted from).
-When the player is found, the enemy will react in the following way:
A) It'll look in the direction of the player and shoot while the player is on sight.
B) If it's too far away, the enemy ship will come closer to the player (up to a certain point, respecting social-distancing of course).
C) If the player tries escape, the enemy ship will chase the player until this one leaves the enemy's vision area.
D) If the player has left the enemy's vision area, the enemy will move to the last known position of the player.
E) If enemy reaches the last known position of the player and the player isn't found, the enemy ship will move forward a few more meters in that direction to try to find the player. (Note: it won't move to the actual player location, it'll simply move forward in that direction, so if the player turns to the side at the right moment, the enemy ship can be lost).
-Player and enemy shots cancel each other out, but won't cancel themselves (enemy shots won't cancel enemy shots, and player shots won't cancel player shots).
-(Pending) Difficulties: Player has infinite lives in Easy mode, 3 in Normal and 1 in Hard. In extra-hard the player will have 1 life and 10 HP (so it'll die after one shot).
-Four types of enemy.
A) Captain, color red: Spawns reinforcements (at 20 HP), has 40 HP.
B) Tracker, color blue: Teleports to the player, harder to loose, has 20 HP.
C) Normal, color grey: shoots faster than special units, has 20 HP.
D) Reinforcement: like the normal ships, but with red lines, spawned only by the Captain ship. 

Boss mechanics: (all pending)
-(Pending) Boss spawns after 20 destroyed enemies (will adjust later during testing).
-(Pending) The player will be teleported to the center of the map and won't be able to leave that area until the boss is destroyed.
-(Pending) Boss will be in the upper side of the screen, following the player on the X axis.
-(Pending) If the player collides with the Boss ship, player dies.
-(Pending) Boss main attack: it shoots the player like the small ships do, but it has four cannons instead of one.
-(Pending) Boss secondary attack: it'll be triggered from time to time, it's a big laser (one shot kill) that takes a few seconds to be fired to a fixed position (so the player can escape it).
-(Pending) Boss has 300 HP (this value will probably be adjusted later during play-testing).

-Play modes:
A) (Pending) A story-mode that acts as a tutorial. Score or timer won't be shown here.
B) (Pending) Story-mode will a speedrun option that skips dialog and shows a timer. Score won't probably be shown here as the idea is to finish the run as fast as possible.
C) An infinite survival mode* with a score counter & clock. The idea being to score the most points and survive for as long as possible.
*Boss encounters are still pending in the infinite mode. The concept is that enemy ships will spawn at random, then the boss spawns after a specific amount of enemies is destroyed. Each boss spawn will be bigger than the last one (up to 4 times the size of the original boss) and will have 100 extra HP (this value will probably be adjusted later).
