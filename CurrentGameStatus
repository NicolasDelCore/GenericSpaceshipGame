-Score counter (to see how many ships you kill, 100 points per ship).
-Player has 30 HP, each enemy shot takes 10 HP. There's no respawn.
-Seemingly infinite map.
-Only one enemy will spawn at a time.estuve 

Next Steps:
-Improve the map-border-crossing mechanics.
Explanation: Currently, the game works with a square map. When the player or an enemy touches a map border (one of the sides of the square), it'll be teleported to the opposite map border, this doesn't applies to shots fired (so it helps the illusion that you're moving through an infinite space, you can't tell if you've crossed a map border based on your shooting or positioning, the background being all the same also helps on this).
The problem is that you can see enemies dissapearing/appearing out of nowhere sometimes. This is because the enemy followed you through a map border. I want to implement a system so that the enemy doesn't simply "disappears" once a map border is crossed. I'm currently testing using cameras for this (a camera positioned in one map border, the output is shown as a texture in the opposite map border, so it prevents the player from seein enemies "popping in and out of existance" after a map border has been crossed). This will also require to change the behavior of bullets when traversing through a map border (bullets will need to be teleported as well, for the camera to record them going from one side to the other). Enemy IA will also need a rework to complete the illusion (a few updates to the way the player is found will be likely needed, so that the enemy can go through the map border when being shotted from the other side and detect the player as expected).
-Fix some problems with enemy positioning when more than one enemy is chasing the player. (This will allow more enemies to be spawned at the same time).
-Fix some radar inaccuracies. (I believe it's because of the size of the texture used for the map: sometimes, the red points that represent the enemies will be outside the radar).
