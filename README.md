# GenericSpaceshipGame
This is a generic spaceship game that I made with Unity and C#.


If you want to play the game:

-Download the zip from: https://github.com/NicolasDelCore/GenericSpaceshipGame/raw/master/GenericSpaceshipGame.zip

-Move the zip file into a new folder and unzip it, then run the GenericSpaceshipGame.exe file (or simply run the .exe from within the zipped folder, that worked for me).


There's a text-tutorial in the game's main menu that tells you how to play, but I recommend reading through the GameDesignDocument (GDC) and the CurrentGameStatus files if you want the indepth version of the mechanics implemented and the intended behaviors.

Thanks!
