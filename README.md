# GenericSpaceshipGame
This is a generic spaceship game that I made with Unity and C#.


If you want to play the game:

-Download the zip from:

(Current) Alpha 1.2: https://github.com/NicolasDelCore/GenericSpaceshipGame/raw/master/GenericSpaceshipAlpha1.2.zip

(Old) Alpha 1.1: https://github.com/NicolasDelCore/GenericSpaceshipGame/raw/master/GenericSpaceshipGameAlpha1.1.zip

(Old) Alpha 1.0: https://github.com/NicolasDelCore/GenericSpaceshipGame/raw/master/GenericSpaceshipGame.zip

-Move the zip file into a new folder and unzip it, then run the GenericSpaceshipGame.exe file (or simply run the .exe from within the zipped folder, that worked for me).

There's a text-tutorial in the game's main menu that tells you how to play, but I recommend reading through the GameDesignDocument (GDC) and the CurrentGameStatus files if you want the indepth version of the mechanics implemented and the intended behaviors.

Note: The Scripts folder (uploaded in this repository) won't contain the A* Pathfinder scripts (used for moving the enemies). A* Pathfinder can be found here: https://arongranberg.com/astar/download

In case you want to delete it, the game's config file is saved in:
C:\Users\*Your Windows User*\AppData\LocalLow\NicosGameNonCompany\GenericSpaceshipGame
It's created the first time you open the game, regulates sound, resolution, and whether or not to show the radar.

Thanks!
