# GenericSpaceshipGame
This is a generic spaceship game that I made with Unity and C#.

If you want to play the game:
-Download the zip from: https://github.com/NicolasDelCore/GenericSpaceshipGame/raw/master/GenericSpaceshipGame.zip
-Create a new folder and unzip the game within (or simply run the .exe from within the zipped folder, that worked for me).
-Run the genericspaceshipgame.exe file.

There's a text-tutorial in the game's menu that tells you how to play, but I recommend reading through the GameDesignDocument (GDC) and the CurrentGameStatus files if you want the indepth version of the mechanics implement and the intended behaviors.

Thanks!
